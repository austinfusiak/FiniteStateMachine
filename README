Description : 
	This project current consists of a finite state machine in c++.  It can be used to process complex state 
	transitions for various stateful objects such as orders in a order management system. 

To Do :
	Seporate main.cpp into class files with proper includes and seporate implements of functions versus definitions. 
	Add a second argument to the process event that can take an object of reference data to be passed into the specific event handlers
